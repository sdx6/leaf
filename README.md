# leaf - LEAh's Fetch

A minimal, blazingly fast fetch program for Linux

Shows only the useful things and does them pretty well

I made this out of dissatisfaction with fetch scripts, either being way too slow or showing way too much information

`leaf` is intended to be used as a greeter to your shell, where over SSH it would show important information to your session that can be looked at from a glance

`leaf` is faster than all fetch scripts currently, at ~3ms on my hardware, compared to ~3s (neofetch, ~500ms cached), ~20ms (fastfetch), ~15ms (nofetch)

# Contributing

Anyone is welcome to make a package for `leaf`

Contributions to actual code is not really needed, all bases have been covered as far as necessary quick-lookup information goes

If your distribution is not supported by `leaf`, and you want to make it supported, fork the repository, and make a pull request with your distribution included

  ### Where to?

  In `variables` > `icons` of /src/main.lua, there is a `construct` table that holds the icons for every distribution that `leaf` supports

  *(Code is best viewed in `vim`)*

  To add a distribution, first find the **distribution ID** by running `cat /etc/os-release` on most Linux distributions 
  ```
   [/home/leah] (07:58:54)
   > strat pkgs cat /etc/os-release
  NAME="Arch Linux"
  PRETTY_NAME="Arch Linux"
  ID=arch
  BUILD_ID=rolling
  ANSI_COLOR="38;2;23;147;209"
  HOME_URL="https://archlinux.org/"
  DOCUMENTATION_URL="https://wiki.archlinux.org/"
  SUPPORT_URL="https://bbs.archlinux.org/"
  BUG_REPORT_URL="https://gitlab.archlinux.org/groups/archlinux/-/issues"
  PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://terms.archlinux.org/docs/privacy-policy/"
  LOGO=archlinux-logo
  ```

  The ID here for my Arch Linux stratum is "arch", under the "ID" field

  Take the first letter of the distribution ID, and find an entry in `construct` that has its first initial as the key,

  For "arch" this would be "a", and I would add it to the key `["a"] = function()`,

  Inside of that table, make another table with the distribution ID as the key

  *(This is not a Lua tutorial)*

  Create ASCII art for the distribution icon, make sure to adhere to the standard look of the previous icons

  ```lua
  ["arch"] =
  {
    tc.bg.cyan..tc.fg.black..[[          ]],
    tc.bg.cyan..tc.fg.black..[[    /\    ]],
    tc.bg.cyan..tc.fg.black..[[   /  \   ]],
    tc.bg.cyan..tc.fg.black..[[  /_/\_\  ]],
    tc.bg.cyan..tc.fg.black..[[          ]],
    text = tc.fg.cyan,
  },
  ```


  ### Making an icon

  There are some things to consider depending on the icon you base it off of

  1. Single color, fill / background, or single line color
  
  > Set the background to an appropriate color that represents the **fill color**, and a foreground color that contrasts against the background color

  > Examples of this are the Arch Linux and Debian Linux icons


  2. Multiple colors, fill / background, or multiple line colors

  > Set the background to either black or white, and have the foreground representative of the **fill color**

  > Examples of this are the Void Linux and NixOS icons


  - Use a consistent set of characters, and test them on different fonts to see how they look

  - DO NOT fill with hashtags (or fill in general), if you need a fill color, it's probably better off as a background color

  - Set the text property to the main color of the icon, if there are more than one, choose the one that appears more often or is more representative

  - Make sure to keep the icon within 1-2 columns and 1 row away from all edges (besides underscores, bars and commas)
  ```
  ,__________,
  | ,______, |
  | |      | |  
  | |      | |
  | |______| |
  |__________|
  ```
  - The icon should rest comfortably in the space that the inner box of this diagram takes up, without peeking out any side, and it should be mostly centered


  ### I did it... Now what?

  With your changes made, recompile `leaf`
  ```
   # make test
  ```

  Run `leaf` again, with the `--override` option, followed by the ID of the icon you added

  If you feel it's good enough, fork the project, and make a pull request~

# Packages

None yet...


# Compiling from source

Clone the repository
```
 $ git clone https://github.com/sdx6/leaf/
```


# Dependencies

Depending on your distribution of choice, install the required programs using one of these commands:
```
 # apt install make clang luajit2 libluajit-5.1-dev
```
```
 # pacman -S make clang luajit
```
```
 # dnf install make clang luajit
```
```
 # zypper install make clang lua51-luajit
```
```nix
environment.systemPackages =
[
  pkgs.gnumake42
  pkgs.rocmPackages.llvm.clang
  pkgs.luajit
];
```

Move to the repository
```
 $ cd leaf
```

Build and install
```
 $ make
 # make install
```

Optionally, install locally instead of system (~/.local/bin/)
```
 $ make local
```


# Configuration

The default configuration file (once `# make install` is run) is located in /etc/xdg/sdx6/leaf/

Documentation for additional functions and variables is listed there as well

`leaf` looks for its configuration file in the same space, ~/.config/sdx6/leaf/config.lua
